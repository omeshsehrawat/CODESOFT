# Installation
* To run any of these projects, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from here.
   https://www.python.org/downloads/

* You will also need to install the Tkinter library if it's not already included in your Python installation. Tkinter is usually included with Python, but if it's missing, you can install it using the following command:
